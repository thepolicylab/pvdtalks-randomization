# pvdtalks-randomization
A repo for code that we will use to assign families and groups to experimental conditions so that we can learn about the LENA technology and curriculum.

This is a webapp using the Flask framework.

To build and prototype do the following at the unix command line within this directory (edited in case you have different versions, etc)

```
docker build --tag pvdtalks:1.0 .


```
